a new campaign mod
your squad has launched you from UNIDENTIFIED planet after conquering the last bit of mass, your mission is simple destroy the planet but a strange sense led you to land in this planet and loosing all contact with serpulo.

your main mission is to enter REDACTED laboratory to set a contacting point to get rescued

beware though there are entities ready to ruin your base 

The waste land event will be coming soon 

The waste land event contains hard enemies that have high amount of health and unique ablities with it looking like a flesh abomination held by two logs(yes logs) so you better get ready and prepare for this insanly hard mode.
